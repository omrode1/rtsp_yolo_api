## üóÇÔ∏è TODO

### Model Testing & Evaluation
- [ ] Batch image/video upload and testing
- [ ] Display detection results side-by-side with ground truth
- [ ] Compute and display metrics (mAP, precision, recall, FPS)
- [ ] Downloadable evaluation reports
- [ ] Model comparison (visual diff, overlay detections)
- [ ] Dataset management (upload, organize, annotate)
- [ ] Support for COCO, VOC, YOLO formats
- [ ] Interactive visualization (click on detections, zoom/pan)

### User Experience
- [ ] Session management (save settings, recent uploads)
- [ ] Model zoo integration (download/test public models)
- [ ] REST API documentation and expansion

### Mobile Version
- [ ] Responsive UI (PWA/mobile web)
- [ ] Native mobile app (React Native/Flutter)
- [ ] Real-time camera detection from phone
- [ ] On-device model testing (ONNX/TFLite)

### Cloud & Collaboration
- [ ] User authentication and multi-user support
- [ ] Cloud storage for datasets and results
- [ ] Share results/models with others

### Advanced Features
